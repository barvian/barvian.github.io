I love building meaningful products in a healthy, constructive team that prioritizes learning, iteration, and teamwork. Success, to me, is when the interest of the product and end user win out over the personal preferences of its creators. I'm very interested in getting behind the intention of things (enough that I'm even building a [purpose-driven todo list app](/works/doing) üòá); I'm usually the person who asks "why?", or "what are we hoping to accomplish with ___?" during project planning meetings. Internally, I try to monitor when my own conversation with team members becomes more intent on winning them over to "my side" vs. trying to get us all to the best solution for the product, whatever that is.

Right now, my focus is on web and mobile apps.

Tech-wise, I'm currently interested in React (Native), and even [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) for building apps. I've dabbled with Web Components, and while I like the flexibility, I think the ecosystem has a long way to come. That being said, I really like the idea of building a component library with something like [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org). I'm waiting for the day when the web becomes as engaging and polished as the best native apps, especially in terms of motion and other UI trends that are becoming best practices elsewhere.

Outside of work, I'm a bit of a hippie when it comes to health and wellness. I love finding ways to promote wholesomeness in the workplace, and I'm an avid standing desk user üòÅ. I'm a former cinephile but still love a good movie now and then (I try to log most of them on [Letterboxd]({{ site.social.letterboxd }})).
