I think the most estimable quality of a professional is their ability to distance themselves from their product.  I work most effectively as a designer when I habitually detach myself from whatever aspect of the project I’m working on, pixels or code. It’s hard to know which decisions I’m making are for myself vs. the betterment of the product until I take deliberate mental steps away from it and try to view the work with a sense of selfless clarity. As a designer, I think it’s an invaluable exercise not only when it comes time to — *cough* — “kill your darlings”, but at every step of a project to help balance personal goals, user expectations, and client requirements. It’s a silent but essential part of my workflow.
