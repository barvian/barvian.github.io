I'm a digital product designer from Chicago, Illinois, currently living in San Diego, California. I‚Äôve worked as a product designer for [SkinIO](http://skinio.com) and a web designer for [WSOL](http://wsol.com) before that. I‚Äôm currently doing contract and personal work but I‚Äôm open to full-time opportunities, especially in San Diego. More information available on [my r√©sum√©](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS1ZRdPaTfBflyKQfvbI2HfstyCWYskAMFGKHK5ckhFGV0brQB86fxRu38x0qlelqFqdGoHSJvbMzwy/pub){:target="_blank"}.

My favorite things about my job are empathy, good communication, and intentionality. I‚Äôm very interested in the [consciousness hacking](http://www.cohack.life) / positive computing / [humane tech](http://humanetech.com) movements and projects like [Headspace](http://headspace.com), [Pillow](http://pillow.io), [MeetMindful](https://www.meetmindful.com), [Productive](http://productiveapp.io), and [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com). I spend a lot of time thinking about wellbeing and how technology can promote it, so I frequently experiment with new ideas in this space and try to share [my results](https://medium.com/@barvian/how-to-configure-your-smartphone-so-it-doesnt-run-your-life-87bfa64c06e3). 

Outside of design I spend most of my time meditating, taking walks, reading, gardening, and volunteering. I‚Äôm a former cinephile but I still love film and try to log everything I watch on [Letterboxd]({{ site.social.letterboxd }}).

Thanks for reading! If it sounds like I'd be a good fit for your company or you think we have a lot in common, [I‚Äôd love to chat](mailto:{{site.email}}). ‚úåüèª
