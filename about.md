I'm a designer from Chicago, Illinois, currently living in San Diego, California. I‚Äôve worked as a product designer for [SkinIO](http://skinio.com) and a web designer for [WSOL](http://wsol.com) before that. I‚Äôm currently doing contract and personal work but I‚Äôm open to full-time opportunities, especially in San Diego.

My favorite things about my job are empathy, good communication, and intentionality. I‚Äôm very interested in the [consciousness hacking](http://www.cohack.life)/positive computing/[humane tech](http://humanetech.com) movements and projects like [Headspace](http://headspace.com), [Pillow](http://pillow.io), [MeetMindful](https://www.meetmindful.com), [Productive](http://productiveapp.io), and [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com). I've written a [tiny article](https://medium.com/@barvian/how-to-configure-your-smartphone-so-it-doesnt-run-your-life-87bfa64c06e3) on my attempts to reclaim attention from my devices, and I plan to write more like it in the future.

Outside of design I spend most of my time meditating, taking walks, reading, gardening, and volunteering. I‚Äôm a former cinephile but I still ‚ù§Ô∏è film and try to log everything I watch on [Letterboxd]({{ site.social.letterboxd }}).

Thanks for reading! If it sounds like I'd be a good fit for your company or you think we have a lot in common, [I‚Äôd love to chat](mailto:{{site.email}}). ‚úåüèª
